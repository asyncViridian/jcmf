STANDARD INSTALL
================
A standard install of multiperm is performed in the usual way:

./configure
make
make install


INSTALL OPTIONS
===============

To install multiperm in a non-standard directory, invoke configure with
the --prefix option.

To enable the use of the R statistical package for random number generation
and statistical calculations, use configure's --enable-R option.

To enable comparisons of multiperm with the rnazRandomizeAln.pl script from 
the RNAz package, use configure's --enable-compRNAz option.


OPTIONAL: INSTALLING THE R SHARED LIBARY
========================================

If you want to use R, use --enable-R with 'configure' as described above,
and make sure that the R shared library can be found. Below is
a description of how to build the R shared library.
 
1) Download the latest source tarball from http://www.r-project.org
   (currently, it's R-2.8.0.tar.gz).
2) ./configure --enable-R-shlib
3) make
4) make install (this is optional)
5) Make sure that the location of the R executable (e.g. .../R-2.8.0/bin) 
   is part of your PATH, so that the multiperm build scripts can find it.
6) Make sure that the location of the R shared libraries (e.g. ../R-2.8.0/lib)
   is part of the default library path or in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


OPTIONAL: INSTALL THE RNAz PACKAGE
==================================

The RNAz shuffling script is only used for comparison purposes 
(using the -z option to multiperm). Use the --enable-compRNAz option
for 'configure' as described above and do the following.

1) Make sure that the location of the "rnazRandomizeAln.pl" script
   (../share/RNAz/perl) is part of your PATH, so that the multiperm
   build scripts can find it.
